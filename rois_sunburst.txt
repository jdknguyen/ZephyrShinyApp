Brain Region Sunburst Plots

Description

Sunburst plots are an interactive way to hierarchically visualize data, including whole brain cell counts. This function is designed for use with the data table produced via [what function?]. The function outputs an RData file (sunburst.R), containing an object (sunburst_plot) that can be called to display the plot.

Usage

rois_sunburst(dataset = NULL, rois = c("CH", "BS"), parents = TRUE, savepath = NULL)

Arguments

dataset
data in list form; recommended to use "all_dataset" output by [what function?]. Used to acquire count data to be displayed.

rois
string vector of regions of interest to be plotted. If not specified, all cells in the brain will be displayed.

parents
logical to include parent regions of your region of interest. If TRUE, only one region of interest may be specified.

savepath
string to specify the full save path for the RData output.

Examples

library(ez_brain)
library(sunburstR)
library(wholebrain)

rois_sunburst(dataset = all_dataset, rois = "P-mot", parents = FALSE, savepath = savepath)
rois_sunburst(dataset = all_dataset, rois = c("P-mot", "MB", "Isocortex"), parents = TRUE, savepath = savepath)
